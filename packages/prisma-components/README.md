# Overview [:house:](../../README.md#Challenge) {#Overview}

This library will contains the Button component agnostic of any styles which means it will contain only the algorithm to make the Button works.

!!! info The hook **useStates** is here to allow the client to simulate state for the Button. It uses the notion of context in ReactJS. So keep it if you want the whole solution to work. Of course, if you have a better solution, we are looking forward to see your solution!

<br />

# Acceptance criteria

- The Button component has to be created by respecting the [specifications](../../README.md#Properties)
- No style has to be created (styled, css, less, etc)
- The Button component has to be exported to be used by the themes library

<br />

# Mandatory

- Propose a clean code solution that respects principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY, etc)
- Typescript has to be used
- Explain your architecture in the **Architecture** section below

<br />

# Optionals

- Test your solution
